14. git branch <branchName>
15. git branch --list
    *shows current branch
16. git checkout <branchName>

17. git checkout -b <branchName> (creates and switches to that branch simultanesouly..)

18. git merge <branhName> 
    if gives merge conflict then it need to be resolved manually.

19. To delete the branch- git branch -d <branchName>
    This will not delete branch from remote, to do so run "git push origin :alpha"
