///////How to create branch seperate from master/////////
14. git branch <branchName>
15. git branch --list
    *shows current branch
16. git checkout <branchName>

17. git checkout -b <branchName> (creates and switches to that branch simultanesouly..)

18. git merge <branhName> 
    if gives merge conflict then it need to be resolved manually.

19. To delete the branch- git branch -d <branchName>
    This will not delete branch from remote, to do so run "git push origin :alpha"

20. If branch was made remotly using browser, then our local repo will not see that branch...
    For this we use, "git fetch origin" It will fetch all the branches which we currently dont have.
    To fetch only one branch - "git fetch origin Contact:Contact"
